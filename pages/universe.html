    <p>The word Universe derives from the Latin <i>universum</i>. The Latin word was used by Cicero and later by other authors in
        the same sense as it is used today. The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction unvorsum — first used by
        Lucretius in Book IV of his “On the Nature of Things” — which connects un, uni (one) with vorsum, versum (meaning
        "something rotated, rolled or changed").</p>
