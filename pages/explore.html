    <p>Celestial bodies and stars have always been a source of great fascination for humanity. There are Greek,
        Mesopotamian, and Aztec records describing various celestial events. In the contemporary era, several scientists
        have made great contributions so that the dream of exploring space could become a reality, such as the Russian
        Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the German Hermann Oberth and the American Robert Goddard.</p>
